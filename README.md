# COMP550 Final Project: 
## Comparing Extractive Text Summarization Methods Across Languages

**Luca Garnier-Landurie, Nakiya Noorbhai, Kira NoÃ«l**

We explore the performance of various approaches to extractive text summarization when applied to different languages. The summarizer models are in the folder `summarizers`, and the execution of the experiments and generation of plots are in `main.ipynb`.

### Required Libraries:
* `datasets` , `gensim` (`models` package), `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `nltk` (`corpus` and `tokenize` packages), `numpy`, `pandas`, `rouge`, `scipy`
